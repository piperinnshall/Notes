# The Fall of Rome

CLAS 207 - Final Lecture

The period that extends beyond the pricipal period, 200 B.C - A.D 200

# The paradigm for greatness squandered

There was no Fall of Rome? But assume that there was.

Traditionally: Year 476 CE

Romulus Augustulus (A little boy) was the leader of rome.

The real power behind the throne was a german called Odoacer.

The only change in 476 CE:
  Roman coins changed from Romulus stamped to Odoacer stamped.

## Sack of Rome

Alaric sacks rome in 410 CE.

This causes Augustine to write *City of God*.

Alaric siezed Rome in a matter of hours.

## Foundation of Constantinople

Raised in 330 CE, and sacked by the Turks in 1453 CE.

# The Transformation of Rome

Transition, Disruption, or Destruciton?

Did the Roman empire collapse, or fail, or did it gradually become something new and different.

Standards of material living in 200 CE were at all time highs.

## Loss of Rome's Culture

Constant civil wars, military invasions, and a gradual decline of a unified political structure.

The Roman Empire did not fall because it lacked a *Donald Trump*. Rome is a multicultural society.

The real culprit of Romes fall, is the civil war between the governing class.

When the governing class was not in-fighting, there was not one succesful invasion of the empire.

This caused elite wealth, but a loss of class and culture.

### Loss of Technology

No one knows the uses of technology after the decline of culture.

Waterproof tiles, potter's wheels and kilns stopped being able to be made.

### Loss of Agriculture

The shipments of grain decline due to the lack of Rome's navy.

The diet of La Fontanaccia, ~50 kilometers from Rome.

Acorns, horse beans, two-rowed barley, and grass peas.

### Loss of People

- Most of Rome is vacant due to:
  - Deterioration of the city's fabric.
  - Rise in disease.
  - Lack of food.
  - Romans leaving.

People only stayed due to the fact that Rome was key to the church.

# Modern Explanations of The Fall of the Roman Empire

(And the hazards of reductive thinking)

- Theories of the fall of Rome.
  - Elitist and Racist Theories:
    - Michael Rostovtzeff (1870-1952)
      > **Aristocracy replaced by vulgar leadership.**
      > Is any governing class sophisticated or cultured?
      > Is it a neccesary trait for leadership?
    - Tenny Frank (1876-1939)
      > **The Orontes flows into the Tiber.**
      > There was no racial purity in Rome.
  - Metaphysical Theories - you can't win.
    - Oswald Spengler (1880-1936)
      > **All cultures thrive, then perish, ultimately.**
  - Climate Theories
    - Kyle Harper
      > **Climate change.**
      > Cooling in the mediterranean.
      > Crop disruption and plagues.
      > Antonine plague: 166-180
      > Plague of Cyprian: 249-262
  - Stupid Theories
    - I Wonder Who Said This
      > **Lead Poisoning**
      > They used lead the whole time.
      > Sectretly elitist, because only elites had lead pipes.
    - Werner A. Krenkel (1926-2015)
      > **Roman Baths**
      > Hyperthermia.
      > Not enough sperm.
      > Sectretly elitist (again)
  - Famous Theories
    - Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)
      > **Barbarians and Christians**
      > Barbarians came.
      > Why didn't Romans stop them?
      > Christianity.
      > The East didn't fall.

A complex development needs a complex explanation.

8 BCE - 1453 CE.
