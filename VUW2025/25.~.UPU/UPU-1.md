Zero-information proof - C02 in strategically placed magnetic towers.

Because of the zero-information proof, the towers locations are not specified.

I'm going to get tortured?

Computer Science is neither a Science nor about Computers.

## Variables

They have names, called identifiers.

We can access them by their names, and we can update the data stored in them using the equals sign.

e.g.

```var.kt
 var a = 21;
 var b = 20;
 val c = a + b + 1;
 assert(c == 42) { "Why is this in Kotlin?" }
```

Swapping variables

```swap.kt
var a = 24
var b = 50

a = a xor b
b = a xor b
a = a xor b

assert(a == 50)
assert(b == 24)
```

NEED a third variable huh.

oh wait i should've just kept watching.
