# Huffman Coding

Data/Text Compression.

Files containing text, sound, video etc. can easily become huge.

E.g. a Blu-ray movie is about 25Gb.

Can we reduce the amount of time/space required to transmit/store them?

E.g. text files are hugely redundant â€“ we use 8 bits (or more) to store each character,  but there is far less information than that.

Compression is about reducing the memory needed to store a file.

Data Compression can be lossless or lossy.

- Lossless:
  - No information is lost - just gets stored more compactly.
  - Can retrieve the original data exactly - decompressing.
  - Important for text and numerical data.
- Lossy
  - Information may be lost.
  - Can't retrieve the original data exactly.
  - Acceptable in some contexts.
    - e.g. JPEG Compressed image files.
