## Explain FOSS

What is FOSS?

Why is our project FOSS.

The legal implications of that.

## What licence should we use?

Should the legal, ethics & policy team be invited in this decision?

## Why Git?

Git is a version control system that tracks versions of files.

It is often used to control source code by programmers
who are developing software collaboratively.

GitHub is a platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code.

It uses Git to provide version control and GitHub itself has other features that Git does not have.

Because we have an open-sourced repo, and many students from other countries willing to contribute on the project,
having proper documentation stored on GitHub will be important to ensure our core internal values and policies
are being held up by outside contributors to the project, in an easy to access manner.

```bash
cd directory

git clone [repository_url]

git add [file]

git status

git commit -m "chore: message"

git push
```

### Who will have to use GitHub?

Someone in the law team may be instructed on the basic use of Git and GitHub.

As the GitHub manager, I am able to assist this person with any issues they may have.

If there are any issues or doubts, ask me before acting.

Command line tools can be very powerful and very finicky.

## Changing the constitution to fit FOSS

This may need to be done to match the legal implications of open-sourced software.

## Code of Conduct

A CODE_OF_CONDUCT is essential for the GitHub organization.

This is because a code of conduct clearly and explicitly highlights
what is expected of employees in regard to their behaviour inside and outside of the company.

This will need to be made by the law-ethics-policy team before people begin contributing to the repositories.

  - [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
