# Basic Principles of Social Psychology

## Basic Motivational Principles

- People strive for Mastery
- People seek Connectedness
- People value "Me and Mine"

###  People strive for Mastery

People do not like uncertainty.

The more able we are to predict the environment, the more control we feel we have.

A perception of control is almost as relevant as actual control.

### People seek Connectedness

Romantic relationships

### People seek me and mine

Bias between groups can be caused by viewing one group as positive and one as negative.

## Basic Processing Principles

- Accessibility
- Conservatism
- Superficiality vs Depth

### Accessibility

Why are Americans more afraid of dying from Islamic terrorism than a school shooting?

Death by cow is more common than both.

Because of: Availability heuristic.

How quickly something comes to mind, the greater likelihood it is viewed of being true.

Things that you experience more frequently are more likely to happen.

However, the brain doesn't work correctly every time.

> WHAT comes to mind?
> - A schema is a structured unit of knowledge.
> - Built from the bottom up.
> - Used from the top down.
> 
> Cat:
> - Personality.
> - Looks. 
>   - Tails.
>   - Whiskers.
>   - 4 Legs.
>
> Different types of schema.
> - Person schema.
> - Self schema.
> - Role schema.
>   - Teacher.
>   - Student.
> - Event Schema.
>   - Dinner.
>       - Menu.
>       - Drinks.
>       - Entree.
>       - Mains.
> - Group Schema.
>   - Stereotypes are schema.

Accessibility is affected by: 
- Expectation.
- Motivating.
- Fears.
    - Phobias.
- Mood.
    - In a positive mood, more positive things will are more likely to be accessible.
- Priming.
    - Recent; Frequent; Chronic.

Higgins, Rholes & Jones (1977)

Evaluation of Gary:
    - If reckless is activated, people think Gary is reckless
    - Same with adventurousness.

> *Encoding consequences.*
>
> - Once cued:
>   - What we notice.
>   - How quickly we do so.
>   - How we interpret it.
>   - What we remember.

Sagar & Schofield.

Participant does annoying action, e.g. Poking someone in the back.

Exact same behavior is viewed as more aggressive if the participant is black.

We are all aware of the stereotypes of our society, whether we believe them or not.

The representation will be the basis for further action by the perceive.

### Conservatism

Once we make a judgment, it will be very slow to change.

You want some stability, but there a lot of mechanisms in place to keep you from changing.

There are a lot of generational changes, but the individual changes are less common.

### Superficiality vs Depth

Most of the time, we don't spend a lot of effort thinking about things.

We have a lot of cognitive shortcuts to process information "well enough"

We can switch that over to a more deliberate kind of thinking.

#### Dual Process Models

System 1: Association-Based, Fast, Efficient.

System 2: Rule-Based, Slow, Deliberate.

The Linda Problem is written to demonstrate bias.

Automatic Stereotype Activation
- Devine (1989): Dual process model of stereotype activation and use.

Study 1: Knowledge of stereotype content.

Study 2: Use of subliminally activated stereotype.

Gave a paragraph similar to the Gary study, that was ambiguously aggressive.

This activated the stereotype.

Study 3: Use of consciously activated stereotype.

##### Automaticity

The Four Horseman of Automaticity
- Awareness
- Intentiality
- Efficiency
- Controllability

(Kunst-Wilson & Zajonc, 1980)
Flashing a shape/object/character very quickly.
> 1. Which one did you see?     2. Which one do you like better?
> 1. Below chance accuracy.     2. Frequent vs infrequent.

Once an automatic process has kicked into gear, it requires 2 things:
- Motivation.
- Capacity.

# Think of these as the basic principles underlying most, if not all psychological phenomena we discuss.
